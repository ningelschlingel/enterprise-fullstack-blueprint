# Decision: Language and Framwork for the backend

## Result

SpringBoot was chosen as the backend framework for the several reasons listed below. The biggest deciding factor was the high expertise in the current team in combination with the general popularity of the framework.

## Need for decision

- For the Bluprint-API, a language/framework needs to be chosen
- Development should start in Q4/2025 and the decision impacts our hiring strategy

## Considered Options

- Node.js: Frontend is basically always relying on javascript/typescript; we'd have one language for the whole app. 
- SpringBoot: Known in the current team, easy to find experts for, Java is really popular too
